# Lab 2. CNN on NumPy (MNIST)

## Task
Create a convolutional network for classifying handwritten digits ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist)).

Criteria:
* The number of layers, convolution dimension and convolution and pooling hyperparameters are at your discretion.
* Train size - 70%, test size - 30%
* Implement calculation of the confusion matrix, which should be used to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, plot ROC-curve, calculate AUC (for each class!). 
* Preliminarily build t-SNE and evaluate the reasons for misclassification.
