# Neural-Networks-Course

This repository is dedicated to the deep learning course I took in Autumn/Winter 2023 during my studies

The criterion for passing the course is successful completion of 6 labs on Numpy on the following topics:
1. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
2. CNN (Convolutional neural networks)
3. RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
4. GAN + VAE
5. Transformer
6. Graph Neural Network

Each laboratory work is placed in an independent directory with the name `Lab_` and the corresponding number.
Detailed descriptions are provided there, including initial conditions, requirements and some sources.

NOTE: not all materials are currently posted.  I will add them gradually after they are handed in to the teacher.
