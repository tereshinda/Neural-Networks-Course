# Neural-Networks-Course

This repository is dedicated to the deep learning course I took in Autumn/Winter 2023 during my studies

The criterion for passing the course is successful completion of 6 labs on the following topics:
1. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) on NumPy
2. CNN (Convolutional neural networks) on Numpy
3. RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) on Numpy
4. GAN + VAE
5. Transformer
6. Graph Neural Network

Each laboratory work is placed in an independent directory with the name `Lab_` and the corresponding number.
Detailed descriptions are provided there, including initial conditions, requirements and some sources.
